I wanted to use the actual raw data from the [MNIST site](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for training my neural network (never pass up an opportunity to dip down into the raw bytes of a weird file format you're not familiar with).

So in the `/data/` directory of this project root, you should put the following files:

* t10k-images-idx3-ubyte  
* t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte  
* train-images-idx3-ubyte  
* train-labels-idx1-ubyte
